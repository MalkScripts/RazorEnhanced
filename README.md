# RazorEnhanced

Thanks for stopping by!

Scripts developed using [Razor Enhanced](https://razorenhanced.net/) on [Excelsior](https://www.uoex.net/)

All <code>.uos</code> files are UOSteam language scripts and were developed with [Razor Enhanced](https://razorenhanced.net/)'s UOS engine. Still they can be used with both softwares.

**If you are switching from UOSteam to [Razor Enhanced](https://razorenhanced.net/)** and your scripts don't all work, please contact me so I can try to make it happen!

Check the header of each script to know: how it works and if additional files are needed (usually at the beginning)

Use these script wisely; you are reponsible for everything happening when you're using them.

Report any bug you can find!
