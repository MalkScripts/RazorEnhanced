# RazorEnhanced

Thanks for stopping by!

Scripts developed using Razor Enhanced on [Excelsior](https://www.uoex.net/)

All <code>.uos</code> files are UOSteam language scripts and were developed with Razor Enhanced's UOS engine. Still they can be used with both softwares.

Check the header of each script to know: how it works and if additional files are needed (usually at the beginning)

Use these script wisely; you are reponsible for everything happening when you're using them.

Report any bug you can find!
